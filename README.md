## Problem Statement

1. An education company named X wants to improve its lead conversion from the current 30% to around 80% by identifying the most potential leads.

2. The company wants to build a model wherein one need to assign a lead score to each of the leads such that the customers with a higher lead score have a higher conversion chance.

## Goal
1. Build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads which can be used by the company to target potential leads

2. There are some more problems presented by the company which your model should be able to adjust to if the company's requirement changes in the future so you will need to handle these as well
   - Which are the top three variables in your model which contribute most towards the probability of a lead getting converted?
   - What are the top 3 categorical/dummy variables in the model which should be focused the most on in order to increase the probability of lead conversion?
   - X Education has a period of 2 months every year during which they hire some interns. The sales team, in particular, has around 10 interns allotted to them. So during this phase, they wish to make the lead conversion more aggressive. So they want almost all of the potential leads (i.e. the customers who have been predicted as 1 by the model) to be converted and hence, want to make phone calls to as much of such people as possible. Suggest a good strategy they should employ at this stage.
    - There are some more problems presented by the company which your model should be able to adjust to if the company's requirement changes in the future so you will need to handle these as well. These problems are provided in a separate doc file. Please fill it based on the logistic regression model you got in the first step. Also, make sure you include this in your final PPT where you'll make recommendations.
